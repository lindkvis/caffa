# About WCaf
Web and Desktop Application Interface in C++. WCaf is based on the Qt5-based Ceetron Application Framework used in ResInsight (http://www.resinsight.org) but supports deploying to the web via the Web Toolkit (https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt) as well as desktop deployment with Qt5.

# Licensing
WCaf is licensed under the LGPL 2.1. However, the Web Toolkit is licensed under the GPL v2, meaning that apps deploying to the Web will have to follow the stricter licensing terms of the GPL v2.
